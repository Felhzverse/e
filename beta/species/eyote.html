<p id="gen">&nbsp;Eyote are dominant species on the tech giant planet of Yeoliv, who share many similarities to the humanoid species on Earth. Eyote are most easily recognized by the slash-like marks covering their skin caused by irregular binding of melanin, called secrame. These markings become darker and appear more frequently with age. Other noticeable physical differences that make them stand out from other humanoid species include being generally taller and hairier than those of Earth.</p>
</div>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Types</h1></center>
<p id="types" >&nbsp;There are two distinct subspecies of Eyote: Cai and Anu. According to legend, Cai are descended from felines and the Anu come from canines. This is merely legend- all Eyote are on the same evolutionary track; Cai and Anu are most easily differentiated based on how their secrame look. 
 </p>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<div class="col">
<center><h2>Anu</h2></center>
<p id="anu" >&nbsp;Anu can be identified by having broader secrame than their Cai counterparts, which dot their eyelids, cheeks, and nose. Anu are also known as being a bit larger and sturdier than Cai, lacking the supposed flexibility that Cai boast.
 </p>	
</div>	
<div class="col">
<center><h2>Cai</h2></center>
<p id="cai" >&nbsp;The easiest indicator of a Cai Eyote would be thinner secrame that can be found framing their faces, in addition to wider ones which cover their cheeks. Cai tend to be lighter on their feet, as well as flexible and prefer to be sedentary. Their ears can be slightly pointer than those of Anu, but this varies from person to person.
 </p>	
</div>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Habitat</h1></center>
<p id="habitat" >&nbsp;Eyote pride themselves in being able to adapt to any climate. This is only partially-true, as due to their sensitivity to heat, Eyote usually prefer to live in places with colder or moderate climates. They can adapt to warmer environments, but must first evolve to their surroundings, as Eyote don’t have a great time in warm environments right off the bat. Eyote found in warmer climates seem to have a more varied diet and less body hair.</p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Common Behaviors</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Eyote are very inquisitive, preferring to think objectively and solve problems. When not tinkering or eating, one can often be found somewhere between the realm of the living and that of those asleep. Unlike humans, they’re not too fond of direct eye contact since it’s seen as a challenge.  
</p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Family Structure</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Families are very similar to those of humans, although they are more matriarchal. Children are expected to get married and have children of their own soon after secondary school. Couples without children are seen as oddities.  </p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<p>Life Stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Infant: Birth- one year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Toddler: 2-4 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child: 5- 10 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adolescent: 10-15 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Young adult: ~15-22 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middle aged: 23-55</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senior: 56+</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Language</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Eyote speak the global language of Yeoliv: Eyote! Although this might seem strange, it would probably be easier to explain Standard Eyote as the ‘common’ language of Yeoliv. Although some basic words are similar universally, every corner of the planet has their own individual dialect, with aspects of terminology changing from region to region. </p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Diet</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Eyote are primarily carnivorous, so their diets are very meat-heavy. Depending on religious or dietary restrictions, the contents or frequency of their meals might vary. In many cultures on Yeoliv, it’s customary to put your meal in a very wide bowl and eat it with your hands. It’s considered rude to interrupt an Eyote while eating, so meals are often quiet until everyone has finished eating. 
</p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Way of Dress</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Eyote tend to dress casually for all occasions. Their clothes are often plain with simple patterns or designs on them, if any. Clothing is usually worn loose so the wearer doesn’t feel trapped, though due to a recent surge in Earth-inspired culture, more form fitting clothes have been appearing on the markets as of late. In colder months, Eyote will add layer after layer of clothing on until they’re warm and go on through the day like such. 
 </p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Religion</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Many Eyote from Yeoliv worship thirteen gods from folklore which represent the thirteen months of the Eyote calendar. Like the Greek zodiac, Eyote tend to try to guess their peers’ personalities based on the months they were born during and the personality of that month’s respective god.</p>
