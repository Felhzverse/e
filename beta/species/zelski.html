<center><h1>Language</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp; Zelski speak the most common language in the area they live. Many are  also taught Kezian, the holy language of Kezianism. It is  most often used in prayer and places of worship, and is only intended to be spoken around other Kezian Zelski for religious matters. </p>

<center><h1>Way of Dress</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp; Zelski dress similar to humans for non-religious events. All genders wear nightgowns to sleep, because this indicates that the wearer is in no position to fight and has quit work for the day to other Zelski. Dresses are worn as a sign of peace. Zelski believe that dresses aren’t  fighting attire, so when one is worn, it’s taken as a sign of peace. In Kezianism, designs on one’s clothing indicate status within the church. 
<br>
<ul>
<li>Apprentice preachers: 1 thin cloth stripe on each arm, 3 black dots on each stripe</li>
<li>Preachers: 3 thin stripes on each arm. 1 black dot on each</li>
<li>Leader: 6 thin black bands on right arm, one dot on each</li>
<li>Keznivizdans: 6 thin stripes on left arm, one dot on each</li>
</ul>	
&nbsp; All genders are equal and have the same standards. There is no gendered clothing. Defenders dress differently than other Kezian clergy. Instead of the standard arm bands and dresses, they wear wrist bands and rompers with black leggings and sturdy black steel-toed boots. 
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Religion</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp; Most Zelski practice Kezianism. Kezians follows the story of a young Zelski peasant woman named Keznivizdan, who lived in Sicily.  Her father was Her father was very ill, but before he passed away, he gave her a pair of dice. He claimed that if she stood in the forest with the dice, they’d guide her way, to a beautiful paradise. One day, she left her wife and community behind to go to the forest like her father said. She walked for days, and when she knew she couldn’t continue on much longer, the dice led her to a place of eternal peace. For completing her journey, she ascended to the status of a goddess, as nobody had ever walked so far, and now she watches over everybody from the Zelskiane religious communities.<br>
&nbsp; Kezians in religious communities go to the preacher’s building at 6am daily to be blessed, and to hear preachings of the word of Keznivizdan. They believe this to be the time they are closest to Keznivizdan because this was the time she was said to have become a goddess.<br>
&nbsp; Mothers are expected to have picked out their children’s names at least a day before they give birth, and it must be confirmed by the church. If the birth happens during the sixth hour(6 am), the baby must have the suffix “die” added onto the end of their name. This is known as a “Kezzia’die” child. These children are regarded as more holy, since they were born during the holy hour. To contrast, children born during the eighteenth hour (6 pm) must have “vre” added to the end of their names. This is known as a “Knicuzr’vre” child. These children are opposite to the holy hour, and are perceived to be troublemakers, or bad luck.
