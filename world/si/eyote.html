<p id="gen">&nbsp;The dominant species on Yeoliv, which share some biological similarities with humanoid species on Earth. Eyote are most easily recognized in the slash-like marks covering their skin caused by irregular binding of melanin, which become more prominent and multuous with age, in addition to their generally being taller than humans. Their only other noticeable physical trait is being excessively hairy, on account of the often-cold climate on their home planet.</p>
</div>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Types</h1></center>
<p id="types" >&nbsp;There are two distinct types of Eyote, that Cai and Anu. According to legend, Cai are descended from ancient felines, while Anu come from ancient canines. Although this is false, as both are simply different variants of the same species, the theory comes from the two factions sharing similar strengths and sensitivities to canines and felines. 
The two groups can be distinguished based upon the markings that appear all over their bodies, with Anu having more broad strokes, while Eyote have thinner streaks. 
 </p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Habitat</h1></center>
<p id="habitat" >&nbsp;Eyote pride themselves in being able to adapt to any climate. This is only partially-true, as due to their sensitivity to heat, Eyote usually prefer to live in places with colder or moderate climates. They can adapt to warmer environments over time by changing their diets and their hair thinning out so they aren’t as warm, but overall you won’t find as many Eyote in warmer locations.  </p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Common Behaviors</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Eyote are very inquisitive, preferring to think objectively and solve problems. When not tinkering or eating, one can often be  found somewhere between the realm of the living and that of those asleep. Unlike humans, they’re not overly fond of direct eye contact as it’s seen as a challenge. 
</p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Family Structure</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Families are very similar to those of humans, although they are more matriarchal. Children are expected to get married and have children of their own soon after secondary school. Couples without children are seen as oddities.  </p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<p>Life Stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Infant: Birth- one year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Toddler: 2-4 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child: 5- 10 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adolescent: 10-15 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Young adult: ~15-22 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middle aged: 23-55</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senior: 56+</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Language</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Eyote speak the global language of Yeoliv, Eyote! Although this might seem strange, it would probably be easier to explain General Eyote as the ‘common’ language. Although some basic words are similar universally, every corner of the planet has their own individual dialect, with minor changes in dialogue from region to region. </p>	
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<center><h1>Diet</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Eyote are primarily carnivorous, so their diets are very meat-heavy. Depending on religious or dietary restrictions, the contents or frequency of their meals might vary, though. In many cultures on Yeoliv, it’s customary to put your meal in a very wide bowl and eat it with your hands. It’s considered rude to interrupt an Eyote while eating, so meals are often quiet until everyone has finished eating.</p>

<center><h1>Religion</h1></center>
<p>&nbsp;Many Eyote from Yeoliv worship thirteen gods from folklore which represent the thirteen months of the Eyote calendar. Like the Greek zodiac, Eyote tend to try to guess their peers’ personalities based on the months they were born during, and the personality of that month’s respective god.</p>
