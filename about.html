&nbsp; Welcome to Felhzverse, a fictional sandbox fantasy/scifi universe written by a group of bored kids who wanted something to do for the summer. It's a big mix of various worldbuilding, species, and story creation projects we've had over the years that came to be part of one huge universe. Although this is still a big work in progress, but we’re very happy with how it’s been coming along lately! This has sort of been a pet project of ours for a few years now, and we’re very proud to finally have it up on the internet!  
<br>
You can also check out our FAQ below, but if you still have some unanswered questions, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:felhzversemedia@gmail.com">felhzversemedia@gmail.com</a>, or contact us through our official Discord!

<table class="faq">
<tr><th id="qB1" onClick="qB1()">When did Felhzverse start?</th></tr>
<tr><td id="aB1" class="faq">We’ve been working on this project since at least mid-2016, although this site has only been online since April 29, 2018!</td></tr>

<tr><th id="qB2" onClick="qB2()">What does Felhzverse mean?</th></tr>
<tr><td id="aB2" class="faq">FELHZ stands for the five original species we had in the lineup. <u>F</u>eratrans, <u>E</u>yote, <u>L</u>ilibethians, <u>H</u>umans, and <u>Z</u>elski. Lilibethians were an older species that got scrapped for time reasons(the creator of Lilibethians had to dip out due to issues with balancing school, work, and other projects.) “Verse” is just our taking the second half of universe.</td></tr>

<tr><th id="qB3" onClick="qB3()">Who runs Felhzverse?</th></tr>
<tr><td id="aB3" class="faq">Well, everyone in <a href="./staff.html">Staff</a> does. We created one universe, and all have our own subdomains that we work on. (Ex: Amir works on the website, Kienen manages social media, etc.)</td></tr>

<tr><th id="qB4" onClick="qB4()">Can I make a Felhzverse OC?</th></tr>
<tr><td id="aB4" class="faq">Yes! Please go the heck ahead! If you’re feeling so bold, please send Amir a picture! As long as you stick to the regulations of a species(physical traits, magic status, diet, etc.), go wild! We love seeing others interact with our content!</td></tr>

<tr><th id="qB5" onClick="qB5()">How can I contribute to the universe?</th></tr>
<tr><td id="aB5" class="faq">The easiest way is to make OCs! Write stories! But if that’s not your thing, you can ask questions and theorize about stuff then send it to us! If your idea doesn’t affect conflict with already established concepts in the universe, and all of Staff like it, we’ll add it in! In addition, we're hoping to be able to start up contests and such to affect some aspects of the universe.</td></tr>

<!--tr><th id="qB6" onClick="qB6()">Can my character be in one of the stories on the site?</th></tr>
<tr><td id="aB6" class="faq">Depends on the creator. <br>
- For Don’t Get Lost in the Woods, Zelski OCs will not be put into canon content.<br>
- For Zodiac Family, once again, fan characters will only show up as background characters. <br>
- For Life’s Expectations, Fan OCs can show up as background or minor characters if the creator of the character so desires. <br>
 - For Don’t Take it Seriously, Fan OCs can also show up as background or minor characters if the creator of the character so desires. </td></tr>
	
<tr><th id="qB7" onClick="qB7()">Can my story be part of the Felhzverse site?</th></tr>
<tr><td id="aB7" class="faq">This is where we’re a bit “iffy.” The stories on site are something we’ve developed together as a group of friends over a couple years. We’ve gotten a feel for the characters and how they connect with one another, and although you’re probably a lovely person with a nice story, we cannot say the same about you. This could change in the future, but currently, no.</td></tr-->

<tr><th id="qB8" onClick="qB8()">I see that some of the species speak languages that don’t exist in real life. Is there any guide to these languages?</th></tr>
<tr><td id="aB8" class="faq">Due to our choosing to focus on visual aspects of the universe and worldbuilding, we don’t have a language guide on the site at this time. We’re hoping to be able to create a translator(like Google Translate, but hopefully of higher quality), or at least some sort of dictionary in the future though! For now, the most we can do is post some minor stuff in World. </td></tr>
