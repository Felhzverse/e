<span id="person" class="cinfo"><center><h2>Personality</h2><br>He’s always up for a good time! But not always bubbly and happy. He’s nice to those he meets and loves everything shiny and fancy. Not the best at making decisions though. He’s usually seen making bold fashion choices or talking to somebody. He loves social interaction, and it’s very easy for him to get interested in things! </center></span>
<span id="appearance" class="cinfo"><center><h2>Appearance</h2><br>He’s a bit in on the skinnier side, he has gray eyes and the whites of his eyes are occasionally slightly pink, they’re easily inflamed because of his blindness. He has black hair, that’s grown slightly longer than his shoulders.</center></span>
</center>
<br>
<center>
<span id="story" class="cinfo"><center><h2>Story</h2><br>He’s an immigrant from France. Speaking no English and being dropped in the middle of a cult was a big undertaking for him, especially because he struggles with PTSD from the wolf attack he suffered, and mental illness is the most taboo subject there. Nonetheless he tries stay positive and make friends.</center></span>
<span id="wod" class="cinfo"><center><h2>Way of Dress</h2><br>Different dresses in quite a strange way. He loves ugly, tacky sweaters, and wears winged eyeliner all of the time. He really doesn’t care what people think of him. He just wears what he thinks is cool. He also wears a lot of band T-Shirts, and mainly either wears baggy sweatpants or shorts that are probably too short. Different’s strange obsession with jewelry is an enigma. He always has at least 3 gold bangles on his right wrist, and he wears at least 3 rings at a time, sometimes more than one on each finger. He also wears gold bangle style necklaces a lot. He also, if in the mood will wear boots with wedge or square heels. But, for the most part, doesn’t put that much effort into shoe choice and tends to wear the same sneakers a lot.</center></span>
