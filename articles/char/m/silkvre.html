<span id="person" class="cinfo"><center><h2>Personality</h2><br>Silkvre can come off as angry and argumentative, and in some cases, she is. She can be cold and isolating to many, and lacks emotion in some serious situations. She rarely ever cries and has never been the damsel in distress. She is a leader type, and sees people who don’t question the system of society and religion as brainless zombies. She’s definitely the type to start a political argument at the thanksgiving table. But despite all of these negatives, if you get on Silkvre’s good side, she will protect you for life. She is caring and understanding to those who have had a hard life, and can form very strong bonds with the special few on her good side.</center></span>
<span id="appearance" class="cinfo"><center><h2>Appearance</h2><br>Silkvre has short, brown curly hair, and light brown eyes. She is chubby and shorter than the average Zelski, and she has fair skin. She has a very strong build, and has been working on her stAmir and her strength since she was a child.</center></span>
</center>
<br>
<center>
<span id="story" class="cinfo"><center><h2>Story</h2><br>Silkvre grew up in a religious (Kezian) cult, with her parents, Raspberry and Stride, and her brother Gold. Being born at 6:13 p.m. and given the suffix “vre” was already an unlucky way to start her life. Her parents, were constantly fighting to be the head preacher. So Silkvre grew up in a house where she constantly saw fighting and abuse. Sometimes she would even get involved into these physical fights between her parents. Once she saw her brother, Gold, just accept the fact that this was the way things were, even though that his father had abused him behind closed doors, she decided something had to happen. She couldn’t just succumb to this like her brother did. She needed to make a plan to escape.
</center></span>
<span id="wod" class="cinfo"><center><h2>Way of Dress</h2><br>Sil is a “jeans every day” type of gal. She’s always wearing some random t-shirt or hoodie paired with cuffed jeans and the same pair of timberland boots she’s been wearing for the past 5 years. She’s always pretty casually dressed.</center></span>
