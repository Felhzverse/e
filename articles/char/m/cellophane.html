<p id="gen" class="cinfo">&nbsp; Cellophane is the CIO of Felhzverse, as well as a record store owner. She is an efficient worker and uses non-traditional approaches to her work. She tends to be a pretty humorous person and tries to get everyone to loosen up a little every now and then. </p>	
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col">
<center><h2 id="person">Personality</h2></center>
<p>&nbsp; Cellophane doesn’t take many things seriously. She’s always somewhat upbeat and willing to go have fun. She tends to be a bit of a risk taker, and acts on impulse. Which can get her into some trouble. She doesn’t get angry too often, only when she is looked down on.</p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<center><h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2></center>
<p>&nbsp;Cellophane has brown hair, and a shag haircut. She has hazel eyes and Zelski ears, which are usually tucked away. She has fair skin and a chubbier build.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col">
<center><h2 id="story">Story</h2></center>
<p>&nbsp;Cellophane grew up in one of the infamous Kezian cults, (Also known as “Keksmauchdie’sen” in Kezian.) in upstate New York, in the woods. She slacked on her studies of the language and religion, and though her parents did not shut her off from the world to the extent of some other parents of this religion, she still felt trapped and depressed. She attended public school through her whole life, and by the age of fourteen she decided to run away from home, with as much as she could carry, and lived occasionally homeless through the entirety of high school, spending lots of time at friend’s houses, food pantries and shelters. She graduated high school in 2008 and decided to move down to New York city to pursue her passion in music, majoring in music in college and working at a small deli in Manhattan. She worked for about a year to learn guitar and become a singer, but sadly never got anywhere, and soon dropped out of college. One day, she got an idea to open a record store when she realized she had two floors to her new apartment. So she took out a loan, and started collecting on the side. After much preparation, she was able to open it on the bottom floor of her apartment and quickly became successful, because of her good prices and the lack of her species in public since most Zelski live in cults. So a lot of people had questions to ask her. Including Lennox. Which gave her a job as the CIO of Felhzverse. She uses the fact that many different people and species come into her shop to her advantage, to listen in on the perspectives of many different types of people. </p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<center><h2 id="wod">Way of Dress</h2></center>
<p>&nbsp;Cellophane dresses for the most part, like a Hippie. She often wears tie dye, circle shades and a wide assortment of capris. In the winter, she tends to wear big fur coats, or classic black hoodies to put up with the cold New York weather. Regardless, she wears a lot of bracelets and rings, and is almost constantly wearing a peace necklace. She doesn’t dress formally unless she is forced to. </p>
