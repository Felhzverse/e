Here's our list of series. The way they work is that they all take place in the same universe, but some take place in the past, some are in the future, and some are in <i> completely different countries</i>. Each one might have small references to characters or companies that exist in a different series, but reading every single story is <i>not</i> mandatory to understand what's going on overall.

<img src="icons/dglitw_pfp.png" alt="DGLITW pfp.png"> Don't Get Lost in the Woods is a story that follows main characters Silkvre and Different, as they attempt to break a cycle of silence in their species, a tradition held generation to generation for as long as they can remember. They are willing to leave everything behind and even do unthinkable things to get their names heard.
