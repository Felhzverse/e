&nbsp; Welcome to the creators' page! Below is information on us, what series we work on, contact info, and stuff like that. If you have general questions concerning the universe as a whole that could not be answered by our FAQ, we really advise you contact us using the <a href="mailto:felhzversecomics@gmail.com"><i>Felhzverse Email</i></a>. That's something we all work on, whereas the various series are controlled person-to-person.</font>

<b>About</b>: Hello, I'm Alice. I'm 15 and always stressing about something. I love drawing and writing. I've been drawing since I was 8 and I've been /actually/ trying to write since 6th grade. I'm also terrible at interacting with people so forgive me if I seem standoffish. I also love animals.

<b>Pronouns</b>: She/her

<b>About</b>:Hey I’m Amina and I overwork myself to ignore how sad I am ;). I’m sixteen, I’ve been drawing since I was ten, coding since I was nine, and I’m honestly just here to have a good time. When I’m not working on Felhzverse(a very rare occurrence at this point), I’m usually playing Ace Attorney, Fantasy Life, or Animal Crossing(all on the 3DS) and listen to music.

About: Hi I'm Gianna. I'm still somehow existing and I'm 14! I like to draw and write. I started doing both in 3rd grade. Around 8 years old. I can't tell if I like drawing or writing more, but I feel I have strengths and weaknesses in both! I like video games too, mostly Nintendo games. Lastly, I really love garlic bread. I hope you like the stuff I work on cause finding something you vibe with is super cool. :)

<b>Pronouns</b>: He/Him
<br>
<b>About</b>: Hello! I've only been drawing and coding for a little while so I'm not really on par with the rest of the staff, but I'm working on getting better. I usually work behind the scenes, so you probably won't notice anything from me. I might make a webcomic later on if I feel confident in my drawing and writing abilities!

<b>About</b>: Yo, I'm Shiro, and welcome to my crib. *fingerguns* I'm a 420 year old Dorito chip who gained the magical ability to disguise themself as a human being. I'm forced into doing this description thing of myself, so don't expect anything too serious. I like hanging out with bae and I'm the youngest flexer of the century.
